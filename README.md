# Splat C
Splat is an RPG with roguelite gameplay elements that I’ve been working on. It
is named Splat C because at first it was called just Splat and written in C++,
but I’ve rewritten it in C.

Almost nothing is implemented.

## Command Line Arguments
### `+res WIDTHxHEIGHT`
Sets the window size to WIDTH by HEIGHT.

### `+windowed` (unimplemented)
Makes the game appear in a window.

### `+fullscreen` (unimplemented)
Makes the game fullscreen.
